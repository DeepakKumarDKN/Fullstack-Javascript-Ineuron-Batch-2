Why React 
---------
React Works On Component Based Approach
    .Suppose i m creating a navbar so the whole navbar will become one Component
    . so whenever we want to use the component we can just call the component and 
        things will work perfectly

Reusable Code
    .Creating the component once and using it again and again .

Dom updated are Handled Gracefully

Learn Once and Write Anywhere 

Babel 
-----
Babel is a library it convert your jsx to pure javascript and latest version of javascript to pure older version 
which have been suppoted by everyone.


const name = "Anurah Tiwari"  // pure javascript.
<h1>Anurag Tiwari</h1> // pure html element.

const name = <h1>Anurag Tiwari</h1> // JSX Element.

npm - node package maaneger
npx - node package executor

npm and npx both are tool which are used for creating / setup an react project

using npx we can execute an package directly no need of installing.

whereas in case of npm we have to globally install it so that we can run our project , we have to install all the packages 

so basically if i want to use an package directly wothout installing it in our system then for that i have to use npx. 


npx create-react-app .
