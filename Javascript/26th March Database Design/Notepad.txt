Social Media App Design 
-----------------------
There are two types of access one is admin and the other one is super admin
admin cannot create a subadmin but superadmin can create both admin and superadmin 

super-admin
admin 
sub-admin 

super-admin is just like owner. super-admin can manage everything, super-admin is the 
one who has more power, sud-admin controlling power willbe less as compared to the super-admin

Database Keys:-
---------------
Key :- Key is one of the attribute of the table. The main purpose of the key is to uniquely identify
any two tuples in the table that means if there are any two row where the information is same for example: 

sname    city     age    rollno
-----    -----   -----   ------
deepak   kolkota   22      1
rahul    mumbai    21      2
deepak   kolkota   22      3

so look here there are two rows where the informtaion is same so now the problem will arise so to uniquely 
identify this we need a key.

so here rollno is also a attribute so now with the help of rollno we will be 
able to distinguish between both the rows so key is an attribute and attribute can be 
anything like rollno, adharcard. registration number, license no, voterid card, phone number.
