Call Stack
-----------
Callstack keep the track of the function call and as well as variables which are 
being defined in the program.

It follows the LIFO Principle.

We use call stack to get to know that what function is being getting executed right now. 
Basically a javascript engine uses the callstack to manage the execution context.

It builds a global execution context and pushed it intp the stack. as we know that in javascript 
whenever a program is getting executed the global execution context is created. 

and if a function is being called then a funtion execution context is getting crated and pushed it
into the callstack and when the function execution gets over it pooped out of the task .

Program for Callstack
---------------------
function sum(){
    let a = 10 
    let b = 20 
    sum = a+b
    return sum
}
console.log(sum())

function sub(){

    let a =20
    let b = 30 
    sub = (a-b)
    console.log(sub)
}
sub()

function product(){
    let num1 = 10 
    let num2 = 20
    pro = num1*num2
    console.log(pro)
}
product()

so first of all global execution context is created and pushed into the call stack. 
after that the sum() function is getting called and pushed into the stack as soon as the
execution got over it popped out of the stack. 

and then sub() function will be pushed into the stack the same thing will happen with sub()
function as well it will also gets executed and as soon as the execution got over it 
popped out of the stack

and now the same thing will happen inside the product() function as well.
